Plagiarism is presenting someone else's words, ideas, or work as your own without giving them credit. It is a form of intellectual theft and a violation of academic and copyright laws. Plagiarism can occur intentionally through copy-pasting, paraphrasing without citation, or submitting an entire work from another person, or unintentionally due to errors in citations. To avoid it, always cite your sources properly for any borrowed material, even when paraphrased.
